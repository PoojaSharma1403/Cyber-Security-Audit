# 🛡️ Freelance Cybersecurity Lab

This repository showcases cybersecurity projects I completed during my freelance experience between 2020 and 2021. It serves as proof-of-work demonstrating my ability to identify threats, audit systems, and implement real-world security solutions.

## 🚀 What's Inside

- 📄 A redacted **Cybersecurity Audit Report** for a simulated small business client

- ☁️ A **cloud security hardening guide** for AWS IAM and Office 365
- 📊 Planned: Splunk dashboards and incident response write-ups based on SOC workflows

These projects reflect my hands-on skills in security analysis, automation, cloud security, and incident response—skills I apply daily as a cybersecurity professional.

## 🎯 Target Audience
