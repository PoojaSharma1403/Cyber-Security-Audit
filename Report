4. Recommendations
- Apply least-privilege IAM policies and enable MFA for all users
- Restrict public access to S3 buckets
- Update Office 365 policies to enhance anti-phishing protection
- Configure Splunk or centralized logging for all endpoints
- Regularly audit access controls and perform phishing awareness training

5. Appendix
